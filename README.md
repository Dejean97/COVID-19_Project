# COVID_Project

This aim of this project was to take some 'real-life' data and draw some insight which could give a bit of an overview of the COVID-19 situation globally.

Inspiration for this project came from [Alex The Analyst's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7cs8q-gJRlGwj4A8OmCmXg) Youtube channel.

The data used for this project came from the Our World in Data blog [post](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) that tracks and visualises COVID-19 related data.

## Project Summary

Having downloaded the data of interest, the data was split into two sets (one containing data relating to cases, deaths and hospital admissions and the other relating to testing and vaccinations). There is no real reason to do this other than to practice JOINS in SQL.
